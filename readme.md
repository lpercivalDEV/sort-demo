## Sorting Algorithms Demo

**Work in Progress**

This is a simple site that will demonstrate a few of the most common sorting algorithms that are used in programming.


Users will be able to enter a set of numeric values and then select the sorting method they would like to learn about.

A summary of how the sorting method works will be displayed. Below the summary will be the original numbers the user entered and it will show the process of how the numbers were sorted.

So people will be able to see first hand how each sorting method works and learn a little bit about which ones may be better to use in certain situations or for different values.
